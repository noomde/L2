# Logistic Module

## Overview

### This module was created to handle logistic/statistical operations such as proportional conversions, calculations, and various logistic tasks. The core functionality of the module is designed to optimize operations that involve scaling values, particularly in contexts where proportional relationships need to be maintained, such as in supply chains, inventory management, or data analysis.

## Why Create a logistic module

### I have been personally interested in a module that could automate these types of logistic calculations, and that interest led me to develop this module (And because of schoolwork). This is the result of that pursuit, allowing for easier handling of proportional calculations and related tasks.

## Features

### - Convert your proportional-values to decimal-values and percentage-values.
### - Easily make logistical calculations such as mean, median and mode.
### - Easily sort your numbers ascening or descending (More easily than before).
